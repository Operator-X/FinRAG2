      "Savings refers to that part of disposable income, which is not used in consumption, i.e. whatever is remained in the hands of a person, after paying all the expenses. On the other end, Investment is the act of investing the saved money into financial products, with a view of earning profits. It alludes to the increase in capital stock.\n",

      "There are some key differences between saving and investing. Both strategies involve accumulating money for future use, but their level of risk is not equal. And how you determine when to save and when to invest will depend on your budget and financial goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, you can do both at the same time, which means you don’t have to choose one or the other. \n",

      "1. **Definition**:\n",
      "   - **Saving** refers to the portion of disposable income that is not spent on consumption. It is the money set aside for future use, typically kept in a savings account or similar low-risk financial product.\n",

      "2. **Purpose**:\n",
      "   - Saving is generally aimed at short-term goals or emergencies, such as building an emergency fund or saving for a vacation.\n",
      "   - Investment is focused on long-term growth and wealth accumulation, often for goals like retirement or funding education.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk**:\n",
      "   - Saving is considered low-risk, as the principal amount is usually safe and may earn a small interest.\n",
